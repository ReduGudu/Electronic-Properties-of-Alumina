     Parallel version (MPI & OpenMP), running on       8 processor cores
     Number of MPI processes:                 1
     Threads/MPI process:                     8

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = PZ ( 1  1  0  0 0 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
